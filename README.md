# SystemVerilog Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of SystemVerilog (.sv) code files for various projects, assignments, and exercises related to digital design and hardware description language (HDL). These files showcase the use of SystemVerilog for designing and simulating digital circuits, including combinational and sequential logic.

## Contents

- **Assignments**: Solutions to assignments demonstrating fundamental and advanced SystemVerilog concepts.
- **Projects**: Larger projects implementing complex digital designs using SystemVerilog.
- **Examples**: Miscellaneous examples and practice exercises covering various digital circuit designs and simulations.

## Features

- Introduction to SystemVerilog syntax and usage.
- Design of digital circuits such as ALUs, flip-flops, multiplexers, and more.
- Structured code for easy understanding of key digital design principles.
- Simulations using SystemVerilog testbenches to verify design functionality.
